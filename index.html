	  <a name="Researcher"></a>
	  <h2>Doctoral Researcher</h2>
	  <p>
	    My very first paid position as an adult (ignoring the high school jobs I had delivering newspapers and working in a military clothing store) was as a research assistant for a PhD candidate faculty at my University.  I spent hours studying methods verifying Self-Assessment and the methodologies surrounding them.  He insisted on having at least 3-5 new sources or articles a week, properly sourced; after midterms, we started seeing reference loops in the bibliographies, so we felt the area was adequately sourced.

	  <a name="SystemsAnalyst"></a>
	  <h2>US Army Systems Analyst</h2>
	  <p>
	    This was a summer job that I was kindof... grandfathered in to.  I used to dogsit for the guy who not only handled security clearances, but also oversaw Summer Hire programs, so it was probably two scoops of nepotism that got my foot in the door.  That said, once there, I worked hard with other defense contractors and accelerated a software development project by about six months in the three that I was there, so I did good work once there.  I also got my security clearance here with little pomp and circumstance.

	  <a name="EventCoord"></a>
	  <h2>Special Events Coordinator</h2>
	  <p>
	    This was another summer job between classes.  The company is no longer in business, but we did light and sound setups for weddings, parties, art exhibits, etc., all around the State.  There were so many weddings (I worked there June/July) on the beach that I doubt I'd ever put someone through that, even for the exhorbitant sum they were paid, for my own wedding.  We'll have to do the electric slide on a proper dance floor; none of this sand garbage.

	  <a name="RA"></a>
	  <h2>Resident Assistant</h2>
	  <p>
	    I worked as a Resident Assistant for two and a half years for different Residence Halls.  I worked with other people to coordinate student events, activities, etc.  I was usually the one who was called in when fines were necessary, so I had the rep as the guy who did all the yelling, though I never actually did any yelling.  If you do your job right, you never have to.  Nontheless, the rep stuck; so people were more scared when I stayed quiet... I did a lot of fun things, too, but for some reason, all I remember is the yelling...

	  <a name="STutor"></a>
	  <h2>Private Subject Tutor</h2>
	  <p>
	    At the same time I worked as an RA, I also worked as a private subject tutor.  I started working through the college, then I started taking jobs on the side to fund my video game collection (this was the era of XBox, Gamecube, and PS2 all at once; my age group didn't have a chance).  While I started with Inorganic Chemistry, my grades and background enabled me to competently teach Organic Chemistry, Calculus and Trigonometry based Physics, General Humanities, and College Algebra.  My groups always had higher grades... and pizza... (because the strength of money is not in hoarding it, but spending it).

	  <a name="Subway"></a>
	  <h2>Subway Sandwich Artist</h2>
	  <p>
	    This got me addicted to Subway Sandwiches, but also made it impossible for me to ever enjoy them again.  After a few weeks of making several hundred sandwiches a day, I started to get pretty good at making them, and my personal claim to fame was being able to make one that looked like the advertisement regularly.  The difference is that mine was functionally edible.  I would work here several times over the next few years until I went back to school for something else, so whatever opinions I have about franchises and corporate oversight of local stores, I'll always have a soft spot for Subway.

	  <a name="Lifeguard"></a>
	  <h2>University Lifeguard</h2>
	  <p>
	    This was my job (with Subway) when I went back to school to get my second four-year degree.  At the time, I thought I'd go for a Teaching certificate with a Theatre endorsement, but I took a bunch of Math classes, too.  This helped later on in life, but I digress.  I'd spend about 4-6 hours a day working on the inside pool during summer classes, athletic team workouts, etc.  We did the normal stuff with chemicals and children... wait, that came out wrong.  We added chemicals to the pool because we WEREN'T allowed to apply chemicals to children.

	  <a name="Navy"></a>
	  <h2>Navy Submarine Officer</h2>
	  <p>
	    I went through OCS in Newport, Rhode Island then bounced back and forth between Charleston, SC and Groton, CT.  In that time, I started up and shut down a functioning Nuclear Reactor, stopped a sinking simulator from sinking all the way, did a deep pressure escape by breathing out continuously for 60 seconds (it was really cool), and was a division officer in charge of facility operations and maintenance with my own crew of 5 officers and over 30 junior enlisted under my authority.  I specialized in OSHA and EPA compliance with a nuclear reactor in a public waterway, so that has to count for something.

	  <a name="EMT"></a>
	  <h2>EMT (Emergency Medical Technician)</h2>
	  <p>
	    After I got out of the Navy, the job market wasn't as fruitful as I was promised (I know, the government lying to its employees; crazy, right?), but there was a trial program to get through all the academic work as an EMT in a little under a month.  We had 10 people apply, 3 people finish, but I was the only one who got certified completely.  After I graduated, I did what all new graduates do: I got a job at two different services and my local first responders, spent my time sleeping at work between calls, and developed a mild tolerance to adrenaline.  In all seriousness, I have seen suicides, I've had codes requiring CPR, I've seen children in trouble, I've seen bones protruding, I've seen deglovings (don't Google that), and I've been to some pretty awful vehicle crashes in some pretty bad weather.  Ultimately, it got me my next job which gave me better money and better sleep patterns... which is kind of sad.

	  <a name="Casino"></a>
	  <h2>Casino Security/EMT</h2>
	  <p>
	    I started as an EMT then moved to the Casino for better money, more regular sleep schedule, and a more stable patient base.  The problem with Casino's is that you have all the problems of hotels, concert venues, restaurants, and casinos all in one: so each night there was no real guarantee of what you would see, but you'd always see something.  I'm not trashing the job, by any means, it had great people and I had a great time working there.  I actually finished my second degree while working nights and weekends at the Casino, so I have very positive things to say about it.  From Thursday nights to Sunday morning, I worked 40 hours in the Casino while full time in school, so at least twice a week I was awake 24 hours... but I'd take that over the exhaustion I had as a full time EMT.  Just keep that in mind when you call 911 again.

	  <a name="Teacher"></a>
	  <h2>Math Teacher</h2>
	  <p>
	    After I finished my second degree, I applied to and went in to graduate school studying for my PhD in Advanced Mathematical Modeling (I'll answer whatever clarifying questions you have).  While I was there, I was teaching different classes in Calculus-based math alongside other graduate assistant instructors.  What I was surprised by was that the teaching of intro-level Calculus is a lot more regimented and micromanaged than I expected.  It didn't help, in many cases, but we did our best.  :)

	  <a name="AfterHours"></a>
	  <h2>After Hours Patrol</h2>
	  <p>
	    I had to leave graduate school for personal reasons; this was the first job available so I leapt at it.  The overnight stuff is pretty straightforward, but there were complications.  Pipes would burst, floors would flood, students would be locked out of their dorms, there would be bats sometimes, we'd get power outages, steam bursts, other equipment failures, and I was the one who was the first point of contact for all these problems.  I got pretty good at being able to tell when there were steam pipe issues just by listening to the water hammers.  We also had haunted buildings, but that's unrelated.

	  <a name="Candidate"></a>
	  <h2>Candidate for Iowa State House</h2>
	  <p>
	    I ran for the State House for my District.  I ran my own campaign, handled the strategy, booked the appointments, made the speaking engagements, and designed all the literature/materials for the campaign.  Despite my intimate knowledge of local and State politics, I don't like dwelling too much on the outcome of the election, so let's just move on.

	  <a name="Driver"></a>
	  <h2>Commercial Vehicle Driver for Swift Transportation</h2>
	  <p>
	    Two weeks after the election I signed on for a training program to learn how to drive Commercial Trucks.  I started working with Swift Transportation after I completed the training and hit the road shortly thereafter.  I drove a lot of commercial freight, but ended my run there focusing on retail food deliveries.  I stopped driving after a particularly bad winter run, but by the time I went back, the industry had contracted and shut down due to the COVID crisis.
